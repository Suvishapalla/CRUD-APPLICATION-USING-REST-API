CRUD APPLICATION USING REST API

Built an inventory tracking system for ventilator availability for various platforms on a single platform. Various tasks are carried out in this system, including retrieving hospital and ventilator information, searching for ventilators by status and hospital name, and performing operations like updating, adding, and deleting ventilators. Authentication is done using Jsonwebtoken in Postman, which is also used for managing REST API (Representational State Transfer) requests.
